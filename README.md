#Swipe & Swipe Engine

##What is Swipe?

Swipe is a domain-specific, declarative language for non-developers (such as designers, animators, illustrators, musicians, videographers and comic writers) to create media-rich/animated documents that contains photos, videos, vector graphics, animations, voices, musics and sound effects, which will be consumed on touch-enabled devices such as smartphones, tablets and touch-enabled set-top-boxes. 

##What is Swipe Engine?

Swipe Engine is the viewer of documents described in Swipe. Since it supports hyperlinking and allows you to browse fron one Swipe document to another, you could even call it a **domain-specific browser**. At this moment (October 2015), Swipe Engine is avalable for iOS and tvOS, but will be ported to other platforms such as Android, Windows and even HTML5 (and we are looking for volunteers to do so).
