#Swipe & Swipe Engine

##What is Swipe?

Swipe is a domain-specific, declarative language for non-developers (such as designers, animators, illustrators, musicians, videographers and comic writers) to create media-rich documents (books and presentations) that contains photos, videos, vector graphics, animations, voices, musics and sound effects, which will be consumed on touch-enabled devices (such as smartphones, tablets and touch-enabled set-top-boxes).
