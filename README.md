#Swipe & Swipe Engine

##What is Swipe?

Swipe is a **domain-specific, declarative language** for non-developers (such as designers, animators, illustrators, musicians, videographers and comic writers) to create media-rich/animated documents that contain photos, videos, images, vector graphics, animations, voices, musics and sound effects, which will be consumed on touch-enabled devices such as smartphones, tablets and touch-enabled set-top-boxes. 

##What is Swipe Engine?

Swipe Engine is the **viewer** of documents described in Swipe. Since it supports hyperlinking and allows you to browse fron one Swipe document to another, you could even call it a **domain-specific browser**. At this moment (October 2015), Swipe Engine is avalable for iOS and tvOS, but will be ported to other platforms such as Android, Windows and even HTML5 (and we are looking for volunteers to do so). 

##Why do we need Swipe?

Because all other platforms (such as HTML5, ePub, Flash and iBooks) requires some form of **programming** to create media-rich/animated documents. HTML used be a simple declarative language, but becamse a full-brown programming environment with DOM and JavaScript. Flash took the same path. 

That's why we came to the conclusion that it's time to design a new langauge, which is powerful enough to describe media-rich documents that allow us to take full advantage of modern devices, but is also **strictly declarative** (no API, no script), easy to read, easy to write and easy to auto-generate.
